When our Co-Founders Boris, Mark and Hanns met in the Ph.D program at Carnegie Mellon‰Ûªs Robotics Institute, they didn‰Ûªt dream about artificial intelligence that sends you speeding tickets in the mail, or shrink wraps shrink-wrap. They were united by a shared habit of saying ‰ÛÏHey, wouldn‰Ûªt it be cool if...?‰Û then actually making that cool thing happen.  Now, we know what you‰Ûªre thinking: we‰Ûªre just another all black-wearing, white cat-stroking bunch of weirdos designing laser-powered panini machines in an underground lair somewhere. Nope. Anki is made up of non-crazy people building crazy-cool AI and robotics that are reinventing physical entertainment. Sound crazy? Maybe. But crazy-in-a-good-way.

The scope of the project you will be working on is:  Eastman Business Park is one of the largest industrial parks in the world encompassing 1,200 acres.  That‰Ûªs 50% bigger than New York City‰Ûªs Central Park.  In terms of building space, the Park is home to 16 million square feet of manufacturing, distribution, office, laboratory, clean room, recreational and conference space.  That‰Ûªs 2.5 times more space under roof than the Pentagon. Ninety-five companies call Eastman Business Park home today.  That‰Ûªs up from 85 a year ago, and our goal is to attract ten more in 2017.  Over 6,000 people work in the Park and over $4 billion in manufacturing revenue is generated by companies like Kodak, Carestream, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Harris, LiDestri Food and Drink, Kodak Alaris and Columbia Care.   As big as we are, we have a lot of room to grow.  From our 2,000 seat theater where we will have a new venue manager, a new marquee and renovations to the lobby to the new energy storage center where eight companies are building batteries that will help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels we are in growth mode.   We are adding new tenants and expanding the footprints of existing tenants.  One of the most important things any employer looks for when choosing a location for a manufacturing operation is talent.  They want to know that as soon as they set up shop, they will be able to hire top quality talent at a competitive wage.  And beyond that, they want to know that as they grow they will be able to obtain the skills they need.  This means we need to work with local schools and colleges, companies and business associations to build a pipeline of talent.  One of the ways Eastman Business Park supports this is by hosting the annual MFG DAY event.  In 2016 over 400 high school students attended a half day program at the Park to learn about TODAY‰Ûªs manufacturing careers.  We had a presentation with high impact video, a panel of recent graduates who are embarking on a manufacturing career, a panel of managers from employers and an interview with a very successful business man who now owns his own manufacturing company.  The event also had exhibitors from 10 different organizations, including employers, educators and associations. We plan to do it again in 2017 and need a skilled organizer and marketer to develop the plans, coordinate among the entities, and make sure the event comes off smoothly.  That‰Ûªs why, for this role, we would like to hire an intern with sales, marketing and organizational skills.   Management of this single, large project will give the candidate a great experience and great resume material.

Our group consists of MAC Specialists (lenders/support agents) and E-Specialists (support agents). About 15 years ago, it was decided that a group of individuals would take all of the incoming phone calls for the branches so we could more efficiently serve our members face to face as well as by phone, and the MAC was born. The MAC is now the largest branch, taking upwards of 30,000 calls a month between about 20 people. We have tremendous opportunities to serve our members with the use of DocuSign to complete new account openings, processing loan applications, and servicing existing accounts for situations that would normally require a visit to a branch. Technology is one of the driving factors that the MAC specializes in and offers support for, not only to our member base, but for our branches as well.Most of the time in the MAC, you will hear the constant buzz of business- there is very rarely any downtime, which is reflected in our successes. Most days consist of constant member contact with less than a minute of downtime, and once a new employee becomes acclimated to the culture that is the MAC, they don't want to turn back.
