*Recommending industry jobs with machine learning*

Team members: Seguel, Pedro; Wei, Shih-Tsai

Tools used: Python{Sklearn, pandas, matplotlib}, Colab, LateX, Github

Skills: Machine Learning{Supervised learning, multi-label classification}

We applied machine learning (ML) techniques using job advertisement and recruitment data to enhance the search strategy of candidates and help them to identify the gap between the job post requirement and their current ability. We expand current research by focusing on the role of the predictive character that hard and soft skills have over specific industry jobs among the same job domain. We extend prior research on job market analysis by using automated techniques of ML, using the soft skill in our dictionary, and by proposing a user interface for job-seekers.
